<h3>Who's it for?</h3>	

<p>Music is needed for videos, commercials, restaurants, events, conferences, elevators, and retail stores, and just about everywhere else. And sometimes music is prohibitively expensive. </p>

<p><i>The Open Music Gallery</i> is the solution. OMG delivers a new way to create, distribute, and experience music. And it's free. </p>

<h3>Sharing, I mean, really sharing</h3>

<p>Today's tools for making music on computers are fantastic. And our computers are networked together. But are the tools themselves networked together? </p>

<p>What if our digital audio workstations could read and write to a common library of musical elements? </p>

<p>That's where OMG comes in. All the drumbeats, all the melodies, all the basslines, made by an OMG app are rated and categorized in the gallery and available to all other users.</p>

<p>The contents of the gallery can be replayed in different keys in different scales on different instruments at different tempos. </p>

<p>Songs and their parts can be <em>(and should be!)</em> remixed and rearranged. </p>

<h3>Experience Music, For Reals</h3>

<p>When I make a song on OMG, I don't send you an audio file or stream. Your music player is a smart device, and OMG takes advantage of this. Music is distributed in "source code" format. That means you get all the parts of the song downloaded to your device, where it is reassembled.</p>

<p>You can remix and rearrange my song immediately in the player. You can take the parts you like and mash them up with parts of other songs you like.</p>

<p>OMG songs are an interactive art form.</p>

<h3>Compression for what?</h3>

<p>Two people (or two hundred) collaborating on OMG could send back and forth revision after revision and changes to a song, all without ever sending any real audio data, since the pieces (the sound of the kick drum for example) were downloaded once and then replayed when the song needs it.</p>

<h3>Do you compose top to bottom, or side to side?</h3>

<p>With multitrack recording you can add layers of audio to create a final mixed audio file, usually about four minutes long.</p>

<p>Today's artists are creating continuous mixes that are sometimes hours long, ultimately combining hundreds of tracks. The tracks in the music are often replaced with new sounds until you have something completely different than what you started with, and the process repeats.</p>

<p><a href="http://omgbam.com">OMG Bam</a> is a music production app redesigned for the new style of composition. You create a section in the old way, vertically layering tracks which are called parts. For example a basic section has at least three parts, a melody, a bassline, and a drumbeat. You then compose sections horizontally, by copying and modifying the parts in the sections as you go. Exchanging one drum beat on one drum kit with another beat on another kit. Layering and breaking down melodies and rhythms.  </p>

<h3>Don't talk about music. Make music.</h3>

<p>I think I've said enough for now. You should try it. </p>

<p><a href="http://openmusicgallery.net">openmusicgallery.net</a> explains more and it a good place to start.</p>

<p><a href="http://omgbam.com">omgbam.com</a> is the official editor and player. </p>

<p>Jam on.</p>
